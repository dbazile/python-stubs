python-stubs

DESCRIPTION

  A collection of Python type stubs I use in IntelliJ that aren't
  available through normal channels. I maintain this junk by hand so
  they may fall out of sync...


MODULES

  gi (pygobject-3.34.0):

    Classes, methods and enumerations taken from PyGObject documentation
    on an as-needed basis (Gtk and Gdk, mostly).

    Source:
    https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Window.html#Gtk.Window


USAGE

  The following works for IntelliJ and Python 3.7, but I'm sure there's
  a cleaner way to do this:

    $ ln -s $PWD/gi ~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gi-stubs

  TODO: add method that works with Sublime+Anaconda
